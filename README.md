# Better Boto

## Description

Better Boto aims to reduce the burden of using AWS Boto3.  AWS Boto3 is a low level SDK for interacting with AWS Services 
and sometimes it feels too low level or too crud like.

Better Boto is a collection of helper functions to make using AWS Boto easier.  For example, it added a create_or_update
method to the AWS CloudFormation client.  It also provides some helpers for dealing with pagination operations and some
help using AWS Organizations.  Check out the [docs](https://better-boto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for the full set of examples.
